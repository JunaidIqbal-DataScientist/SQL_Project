# SQL Portfolio Project: Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an SQL project that involves comprehensive data analysis using structured query language (SQL). The project demonstrates proficiency in SQL by querying and analyzing various datasets to extract valuable insights.

### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to showcase skills in database management and data analysis using SQL. The analysis involves writing efficient SQL queries to extract, manipulate, and analyze data from a given database.

### Key Features
1. **Data Extraction**: Fetching data from various tables and views to gain insights into different entities within the dataset.
2. **Data Filtering and Aggregation**: Applying `WHERE` clauses, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` clauses to filter and summarize data for meaningful analysis.
3. **Joins and Relationships**: Using various types of joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) to combine data from multiple tables and explore relationships between different entities.
4. **Subqueries and Nested Queries**: Employing subqueries and nested queries to perform advanced data extraction tasks.
5. **Data Analysis**: Analyzing key metrics such as sales, customer demographics, and other relevant business insights based on the dataset.

### SQL Techniques Demonstrated
- **SELECT Statements**: Used to fetch data from the database.
- **JOINs**: Combining tables to find relationships between entities.
- **GROUP BY**: Aggregating data for summary statistics.
- **WHERE & HAVING Clauses**: Filtering data based on conditions.
- **Subqueries**: Writing inner queries to support complex data extraction.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Utilizing functions like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, etc., to summarize data.
- **ORDER BY**: Sorting data based on specific columns.

### Dataset Description
The project uses a database with several tables representing different entities (e.g., customers, transactions, products). The analysis aims to answer key business questions, such as:
- Total sales by product category.
- Customer demographic analysis.
- Revenue generation over time.
- Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.

### How to Use
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JunaidIqbal-DataScientist/SQL_Project.git
   ```
2. **Open the SQL script**:
   The SQL script `SQL_Portfolio_Project_Junaid_Iqbal.sql` contains all the queries and solutions for the project.
   
3. **Run the queries**:
   You can run the SQL queries in any SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.) after setting up the relevant database.

### Key SQL Queries
1. **Sales Analysis**:
   - Query to calculate total sales per product category.
   - Query to analyze sales trends over time.
   
2. **Customer Demographics**:
   - Query to extract customer information by region and analyze purchasing patterns.
   
3. **Revenue Insights**:
   - Query to determine total revenue and its distribution across product lines.
   
4. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Query to segment customers based on purchase frequency and total spend.

### Tools Used
- **SQL**: The primary language used for querying and analyzing the data.
- **SQL Database**: The project works with a relational database that consists of multiple related tables.
